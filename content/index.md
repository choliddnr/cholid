### Testing GitHub action

I just started my journey to become a professional web developer a few months ago. Even though I have been knowing and learning about web development since 2010. I never made myself a professional web developer before.  I'm just learning and making web apps for hobbies and personal or community use.  Even though I have less experience in the professional web development world, I have enough skill and knowledge to develop and build a web app, especially using VueJS or NuxtJS. For now, I'm focused on becoming a professional web developer. My primary tech stack is VueJS/NuxtJS or PHP/Laravel 

Before deciding to become a professional web developer, I was an entrepreneur and a computer technician. In addition, I have explored a wide range of engineering fields, such as network engineering, embedded systems, and computer engineering. I've also been exposed to various programming languages, such as Python to create an AI, LabVIEW to Program National Instrument products like MyRIO, or PLC for industrial automation machines.

I have started to learn web dev seriously is about 2 years ago when I realized that my business needed software to manage my team's work. I knew VueJS before but never learn it seriously. Since that time, I've been learning and exploring the VueJS ecosystem. At the same time, I'm also developing my own web app for my business in my free time. Unfortunately, that web app never finished due to my business performance was not going well.
