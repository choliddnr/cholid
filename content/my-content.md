Here is some content.

### Testing GitHub action

::Paragraph
I recently began my journey to become a professional web developer, although my interest in web development actually started back in 2010. For many years, I treated it more as a hobby — building web apps for personal projects, community use, or just for fun. I never made the leap into doing it professionally… until now.

::Paragraph
Despite having limited experience in the professional web development world, I’ve built a strong foundation in building modern web applications — especially using Vue.js and Nuxt.js. I’m now focused on taking that experience to the next level and building a career in web development. My current tech stack revolves around Vue.js/Nuxt.js ecosystem.

::Paragraph
Before shifting into web development full-time, I worked as an entrepreneur and computer technician. Over the years, I’ve explored various areas in tech and engineering — from network engineering to embedded systems and industrial automation. I’ve also dabbled with different programming languages, using Python for AI experiments, LabVIEW for National Instruments hardware like the MyRIO, and PLC programming for factory machines.

::Paragraph
My deeper dive into web development began about two years ago, when I realized my own business needed a custom web app to help manage my team. I already knew about Vue.js at the time, but that project pushed me to learn it seriously. Since then, I’ve been exploring the Vue ecosystem while working on that app in my free time. Unfortunately, the app was never finished, as my business took a downturn — but the experience solidified my decision to pursue web development professionally.
