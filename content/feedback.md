# Feedback App ‚Äì A Simple Feedback Collection Tool

::SectionTitle
What is this?
::

::Paragraph
This is a simple app built to collect customer feedback about products.

::SectionTitle
Why did I create this app?
::
::Paragraph
Initially, I created this app to gather feedback from my own customers. My goal was to keep it as simple as possible to ship quickly. However, as I worked on it, I realized the potential to turn it into a SaaS product. That‚Äôs when I began exploring different architectures and tech stacks to find the best fit for my goals.

Architecture & Tech Stack
::
::Paragraph
At first, I used **PocketBase** as the backend. It offers out-of-the-box features like a database, storage, and authentication, making it easy to get started quickly. I paired it with **Nuxt 3** and **Nitro**, using Nitro as a Backend For Frontend (BFF). At that point, it seemed like all I needed.
::
::Paragraph
Later, I reconsidered the deployment strategy. Deploying PocketBase and Nuxt separately didn‚Äôt feel efficient. So, I decided to remove PocketBase and instead implement all core services directly within Nitro. Here's what I used:
::
::Paragraph

1. **SQLite** ‚Äì A lightweight, file-based relational database that fits this project well.
2. **Drizzle ORM** ‚Äì Since SQLite may become less performant as the user base grows, I wanted an ORM to abstract the database and make migrations easier. I considered both Prisma and Drizzle (I've used both before) and found Drizzle more suitable for this project.
3. **unstorage** ‚Äì Since I'm using Nuxt, I was already familiar with the UnJS ecosystem. `unstorage` was a natural fit for handling storage.
4. **better-auth** ‚Äì For now, this library provides the best balance of flexibility and simplicity for authentication.

   Deployment
   ::
   ::Paragraph
   For the demo, I deployed the app on **Cloudflare Pages** (a free hosting platform). Due to its limitations, I had to make a few adjustments:

   1. Switched to **Cloudflare D1** for the database and implemented custom "transaction-like" logic, as D1 doesn‚Äôt support real transactions yet.

   2. Used **Bunny.net** for external file storage, which provides a performant and affordable solution.
